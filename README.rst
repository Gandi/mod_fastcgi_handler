mod_fastcgi_handler is a very simple FastCGI implementation derived from
mod_fastcgi and mod_proxy_fcgi. mod_fastcgi_handler does not implement a
process manager, nor does it support Authenticator and Authorizer roles.
mod_fastcgi_handler is a module for rapidly deploying FastCGI applications with
Apache.

Rationale
=========

mod_fastcgi and mod_fcgid both include a huge process manager code, which is
not needed with a typical FastCGI application. Such applications, including
Django and PHP-FPM, ship their own process manager and provide a socket to
communication with the web server. Thus a simple mechanism for talking to this
socket is required. While mod_fastcgi and mod_proxy_fcgi both provide such a
feature, the former has a quite complex configuration syntax while the latter
does not support unix domain sockets.

The solution is to provide simple handler for external FastCGI applications.
